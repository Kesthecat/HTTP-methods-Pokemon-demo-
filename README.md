# HTTP-methods-Pokemon-demo-
Frontend and Backend code to show different HTTP methods and how they are connected. </br>
This demo only includes theory until HTTP methods. You can improve the code as you learn more about Node.js! 

## To run the demo
First, fork then clone like you've been doing. Don't mess with the original repo unless you are an instructor!</br>

Open two terminals. </br>
In the first one, `cd frontend` then `yarn install`. Start it with `yarn dev:frontend`. </br>
In the second terminal, `cd backedn` then `yand install`. Start the server with `yarn dev:backend`. </br>

Have fun!
