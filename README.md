# HTTP-methods-Pokemon-demo-
Frontend and Backend code to show different HTTP methods and how they are connected.\ 
This demo only includes theory until HTTP methods. You can improve the code as you learn more about Node.js! 

## To run the demo
First, fork then clone like you've been doing. Don't mess with the original repo unless you are an instructor!\

Open two terminals. \
In the first one, `cd frontend` then `yarn install`. Start it with `yarn dev:frontend`. \
In the second terminal, `cd backedn` then `yand install`. Start the server with `yarn dev:backend`. \

Have fun!
